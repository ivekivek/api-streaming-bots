## YouTube

To use bot for YouTube livechat first you need to get oauth access token with endpoint `localhost:3000/v1/youtube/oauth/get_token` it would automatically redirect you to login with your Google account and to give bot access to manage account. After that you would need to create oauth file to save access token with endpoint `localhost:3000/v1/youtube/start?msg=&id=&access_token=` where msg is for message you want to send, id is for livestream id and access_token which you get from last endpoint. This endpoint is for saving access token to file and automatically redirect to starting bot. After that you can use only `localhost:3000/v1/youtube?id=&msg=` without access_token parameter.
